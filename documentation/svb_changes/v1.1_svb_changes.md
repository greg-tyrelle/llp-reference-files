# SVB Change Log - v1.1

## Date: 2025-09-15

## Change: SF3B1 chr2:198266611 p.G742D is a nocall due to the proximity of strand bias in LLNP

### SVB Entry Modified
- **Action:** ADD
- **Position:** chr2:198266607-198266608
- **Entry:** `chr2    198266607   198266608   sipara  REF=A;OBS=;BSTRAND=Ss0.45363:0.450000   NONE`

### Clinical Context
- **Gene/Variant:** SF3B1 chr2:198266611 p.G742D
- **Customer/Sample ID:** Customer reported case
- **Original Issue:** False negative - variant present at 22% allele frequency was reported as "no call"

### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause:** Upstream variant at chr2:198266607-198266608 causing strand bias artifact that interfered with calling of the true SF3B1 variant at chr2:198266611
- **Frequency:** Isolated case, but SF3B1 p.G742D is clinically significant in lymphoid malignancies
- **Impact:** Missed clinically actionable variant in lymphoid panel

### Solution Implemented
- **SVB Action:** Added SVB entry to block the upstream artifact region (chr2:198266607-198266608) that was causing strand bias
- **Expected Outcome:** Allow proper calling of SF3B1 chr2:198266611 p.G742D variant at 22% allele frequency
- **Validation:** Confirmed that blocking the upstream strand bias region enables detection of the SF3B1 variant

### Files Changed
- `panel_v1/svb/current_svb.bed`
- Archived previous version as `v1.0_svb.bed`

### Panel Information
- **Panel Version:** LLP v1.1
- **Validated by:** GT
- **References:** Customer case report, SF3B1 clinical significance in lymphoid malignancies

### Next Steps
1. Monitor for similar strand bias issues in SF3B1 region
2. Consider additional SF3B1 hotspot validation
3. Review other potential strand bias interference sites in key lymphoid genes

## Change: ARID1A c.4555delC chr1:27101267 GCCCCCCAG>GCCCCCAG homopolymer false negative correction

### SVB Entry Added
- **Action:** ADD
- **Position:** chr1:27101266-27101268
- **Entry:** `chr1	27101266	27101268	hotspot	REF=GC;OBS=G;BSTRAND=SP0.07:0.07;adjust_sigma=1;filter_unusual_predictions=0.3   NONE`

### Clinical Context
- **Gene/Variant:** ARID1A c.4555delC chr1:27101267 (GCCCCCCAG>GCCCCCAG, REF=GC;OBS=G)
- **Customer/Sample ID:** Not provided (observed in 2 samples)
- **Original Issue:** False negative in homopolymer region

### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause:** Homopolymer region with bidirectional signal shift patterns preventing standard strand bias correction
- **Technical Issue:** Two BAM files showed very different signal shift directions, making FWDB/REVB overrides ineffective
- **Frequency:** Observed in 2 samples
- **Impact:** Missed variant calls in challenging homopolymer region

### Solution Implemented
- **SVB Action:** Added SVB entry with specialized overrides for unpredictable signal patterns
- **Parameters Used:**
  - `filter_unusual_predictions=0.3` - handles unpredictable signal patterns (used in combination with adjust_sigma=1, no stringency override needed)
  - `adjust_sigma=1` - manages variability
  - `SP0.07:0.07` - reduces low-level false positive noise
- **Rationale:** Bidirectional signal shifts require filter_unusual_predictions override rather than FWDB/REVB correction
- **Expected Outcome:** Improved variant calling in this challenging homopolymer region

### Files Changed
- `panel_v1/svb/current_svb.bed`
- Archived previous version as `v1.1_svb.bed`

### Panel Information
- **Panel Version:** LLP v1
- **Validated by:** JN
- **References:** FST-23909

### Next Steps
1. Monitor for similar homopolymer region issues in other genes
2. Evaluate effectiveness of filter_unusual_predictions override in similar contexts
3. Document bidirectional signal shift patterns for future reference
