# Hotspot Change Log - v1.0

## Date: 05/Jun/24

## Change: KMT2D c.5549del chr12:49436953 GC>G False Negative HP region

### Hotspot Entry Modified
- **Action:** ADD
- **Locus:** chr12:49436952
- **Variant Type:** HP INDEL
- **Entry:** `chr12	49436952	49436954	SPB.G1850Afs*2	REF=GC;OBS=G;adjust_sigma=1;FWDB=0.29`

### Clinical Context
- **Gene/Variant:** KMT2D c.5549del chr12:49436953 (GC>G deletion in homopolymer region)
- **Sample ID:** Not provided (observed in 2 samples)
- **Original Issue:** False negative - variant not called in homopolymer region

### Problem Analysis
- **Root Cause:** Homopolymer indel calling inconsistency without proper signal normalization
- **Frequency:** Observed in 2 samples
- **Impact:** Sensitivity issue - missed variant calls in KMT2D gene

### Solution Implemented
- **Hotspot Action:** Added new hotspot entry with optimized parameters for HP indel calling
- **Parameters Changed:**
  - `adjust_sigma=1`: Makes HP indel calling consistent (standard starting point for HP indel optimizations)
  - `FWDB=0.29`: Accommodates similar forward signal shifts observed in both samples
- **Rationale:** Most HP indel call optimizations should start with adjust_sigma=1 for consistency, then add strand bias correction (FWDB) to handle systematic signal shifts
- **Expected Outcome:** Improved sensitivity for this KMT2D variant in homopolymer context
- **Validation Results:** After changes, variant was called in both samples

### Impact Analysis
- **Before Change:** Variant not called in either sample (false negatives)
- **After Change:** Variant successfully called in both samples
- **Validation Cohort:** 2 samples (no broader validation cohort available)

### Files Changed
- `panel_v1/hotspot/current_hotspot.bed`
- Archived previous version as `v1.0_hotspot.bed`

### Panel Information
- **Panel Version:** v1
- **Validated by:** JN
- **References:** FST-23910

### Next Steps
1. Monitor KMT2D variants in homopolymer regions for similar calling issues
2. Consider expanding validation cohort for this hotspot entry
3. Evaluate if similar adjust_sigma=1 + FWDB approach applies to other HP regions
